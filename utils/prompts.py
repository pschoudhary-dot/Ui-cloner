**Primary Goal:** Analyze the provided website screenshot and generate a **single, complete, self-contained HTML file** that replicates the visual appearance and static layout shown. Adherence to the following instructions is absolutely critical.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**

1.  **Output Format:**
    *   Your response MUST be **ONLY** the raw HTML code.
    *   Start **directly** with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
    *   End **directly** with `</html>`.
    *   **DO NOT** include any introductory text, explanations, comments outside code tags, or markdown formatting (like ```html ... ```).

2.  **Completeness & Accuracy:**
    *   Generate the **FULL HTML code** for the **ENTIRE visible area** in the screenshot. Do not truncate or provide partial code. If the code is long, continue generating until the closing `</html>` tag is reached.
    *   Replicate the layout precisely. Utilize modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid) effectively for positioning and structure.
    *   Pay meticulous attention to detail: spacing, padding, margins, alignment, borders, shadows, corner rounding.
    *   Match colors exactly using hexadecimal codes (e.g., `#FFFFFF`) if identifiable from the screenshot.
    *   Replicate typography: Use common web fonts (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, 'sans-serif', 'serif') and match font sizes, weights, styles (italic/normal), and text colors as closely as possible.
    *   Include ALL visible text content from the screenshot directly within the appropriate HTML tags.

3.  **Single File Structure:**
    *   Embed ALL necessary CSS rules within `<style>` tags placed inside the `<head>` section of the HTML document.
    *   If minimal JavaScript is absolutely required to replicate the *static appearance* shown (e.g., a specific initial state of a non-interactive element), embed it within `<script>` tags placed just before the closing `</body>` tag. **DO NOT** add functionality, interactions, animations, or complex logic.

4.  **Image Placeholders:**
    *   **DO NOT** use `<img>` tags or external image URLs.
    *   Where an image appears in the screenshot, use a placeholder `<div>` tag containing the exact text 'add your image'.
    *   Style this placeholder `<div>` with a background color, border, and approximate dimensions (width/height) based on the image in the screenshot. Example: `<div style="width:150px; height:100px; background-color:#eee; border:1px dashed #ccc; display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; color:#888; font-size:12px; text-align:center;">add your image</div>`

**Process:** Carefully examine the screenshot provided. Generate the complete, single-file HTML code according to all instructions above. Ensure the final output is only the raw HTML code.
